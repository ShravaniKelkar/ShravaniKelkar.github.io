    <h1> WHY KEEPING PASSWORD SAFE IS IMPORTANT? </h1>  

    <div class="content">       
        <p> 
            Storing passwords securely will help keep your important accounts safe from prying eyes trying to steal your data or your money. Hackers can use a variety of techniques to crack weak passwords and wreak havoc on your life. The risks of failing to store passwords securely are:<br><br><br>
        </p>

        <p> 
           1. Identity theft — An identity thief who gets into a key account may be able to steal important personal information, from your full name to your address to your Social Security number. They can use this information to impersonate you, open credit accounts in your name, and create a mess that may take months to fix.  <br><br>         
           2. Account takeover — A hacker may be able to gain control of one or more of your accounts, from email to social media. While you work to regain access, the attacker may message your colleagues, family, or friends to ask for money or scam them out of their private information.<br><br>
           3. Financial loss - A cybercriminal who gets your bank password may access your account before you realize there's a problem. There are federal protections for unauthorized transactions, but resolving the issue can take time and leave you broke for months.

            To keep your accounts secure, make a strong password that's difficult to guess and store it in a password manager so you won't forget. A strong password is more resistant to guessing, so it's unlikely to be found in a brute force dictionary hack.
            The best way to create a secure password is to start with a simple password and turn it into a complex one.
            The table below shows examples of a simple password that is progressively made more complex. The first column lists simple words that are easy to remember and are found in the dictionary. The second column is a modification of the first column. The last column shows how the simple password is converted into one that is harder to figure out.
            Here are     examples of password variations that purposely avoid using complete English word patterns: </p>

        <table>
            <th> Dog.lov3r </td> <tr></tr>
            <th> dOG.lov3r </td ><tr>            
            <th> dOG.lov3r </td> <tr>
            <th>i7ovemydog!!</th> <tr>
            <th>d0gsaremybestfr13nds</th> <tr>
            <th>sn00pdoggyd0G</th ><tr>
            <th>Karm@beatsDogm@</th><tr>
            <th>C@ts-and-Dogs-Living-together</th>
        </table>

        <p>By injecting numbers and special characters instead of letters, these passwords take exponentially longer for a dictionary program to guess.
